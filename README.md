# Problem
The problem I have been facing for so long and a problem that's quite annoying is making an appointment for a haircut. 
Usually, you call them or go there personally and choose a time slot that suits you the best among the remaining ones. <br/>  
However that is where the problem is, first of all in both scenarios we either stop the hairdresser from working so they can answer the call, or we wait until he's done. If he stops the customer is waiting, if he doesn't answer I'm waiting for his call when he's done, usually there might be a few missed calls and there is a chance worker will forget or will be busy to call you because the next customer comes in.  <br/><br/>
Afterward, the worker has to write their personal information somewhere, some of them do that on paper or in some sort of text document on their laptop, there can be easy misunderstandings or it can be lost, which happened a few times.  <br/><br/>
Also, a problem is when the salon is on the holiday and is not working, how do you know that? Have to go personally and see the paper on the door?
# Solution
My proposal for the solution is a website where the interaction between worker and customer would be reduced to a minimum and there would not be an unnecessary waste of time.  <br/><br/>
Furthermore, all available time slots would be visible and it would be faster to make an appointment and fill in your personal information and the worker would not spare his time or the time of the customer because he will get everything in his schedule. <br/>  
Also, workers can announce a holiday so everyone can see and be notified of non-working days.
